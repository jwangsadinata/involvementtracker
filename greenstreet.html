        <p>The Green Street Teaching and Learning Center is a community-based studio that develops, applies, and disseminates best practices in experiential teaching and learning which enhance Wesleyan and the greater community. The arts are at the heart of our programs and now we apply similar approaches to math and science education. In our work, we aim to:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Offer engaging educational and enriching programs for children and provide high-quality, innovative professional development opportunities for K-12 teachers that explore art, math, and science, allowing for focused and interdisciplinary work.</li>
            <li>Provide meaningful opportunities for Wesleyan students, staff, and faculty members to engage and build relationships with the Middletown community and statewide while supporting experiential learning and scholarship.</li>
            <li>Support a vibrant neighborhood in Middletownâ€™s North End, both directly through services and partnerships with the North End Action Team and other community partners, and indirectly by bringing positive, healthy activity into the neighborhood.</li>
        </ul>
